1. React Query for State Management and Data Fetching
   - Used `useQuery` hook for efficient data fetching and caching
   - Benefits:
     - Automatic background refetching
     - Built-in loading and error states
     - Simplifies data synchronization
     - Reduces boilerplate for API calls
   - Example in `EntryList` and `SummaryDashboard` components where data is fetched with loading/error handling

2. Modular Component Architecture
   - Broke down complex features into smaller, reusable components
   - Examples:
     - Analytics components (`CategoryDistribution`, `CalendarHeatmap`)
     - Separate concerns for entry list, entry creation, and analytics
   - Advantages:
     - Improved code maintainability
     - easier testing
     - Better performance through component-level optimization

3. Responsive Design with Tailwind CSS
   - Utilized Tailwind's utility classes for responsive layouts
   - Grid and flex layouts with responsive breakpoints
   - Dynamic styling (e.g., `grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2`)
   - Allows quick UI adaptations across different screen sizes without custom CSS

4. Server-Side Authentication and Authorization
   - Used NextAuth for session management
   - Server-side session checking in API routes
   - Secure user-specific data access
   - Example in analytics API route:
     ```typescript
     const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
     if (!session || !session.user.id) {
       return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
     }
     ```

5. Flexible Analytics with Dynamic Timeframe Selection
   - Implemented dynamic data retrieval based on selected timeframe
   - Backend logic to calculate start date dynamically
   - Supports multiple timeframes: 30 days, 90 days, 1 year, all-time
   - Provides flexible, user-configurable insights
   - Example in analytics API route's date calculation:
     ```typescript
     switch (timeframe) {
       case '30days':
         startDate = subDays(today, 30);
         break;
       case '90days':
         startDate = subDays(today, 90);
         break;
       // ... other cases
     }
     ```
